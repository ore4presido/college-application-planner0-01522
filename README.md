College Application Tracker

This is a web app I built with the aid of Lovable to help my classmates and I stay organized during our college application process.
It allows users to track deadlines, record application progress, and manage multiple schools easily in one place.
Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui for a clean and modern interface.
